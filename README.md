# Tweet Generation Finetuned

A repository for fine-tuning a transformer model to generate tweets. This project leverages a pre-trained transformer and fine-tunes it on a tweet dataset to produce human-like tweet generations based on a given prompt.

## Overview

This repository demonstrates how to fine-tune a transformer model to generate tweets. The fine-tuned model is capable of producing tweets that mimic the style and structure of the training data. This project includes:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Scripts to clean and prepare raw tweet data.
- **Fine-tuning:** A fine-tuning process using custom hyperparameters tailored to tweet generation.
- **Tweet Generation:** A script to generate tweets based on user-provided prompts.

## Dataset

The training data consists of tweets collected from various sources. Each tweet has been preprocessed to remove noise such as URLs, mentions, and special characters.

### Data Source
- Provide the original source of your tweet dataset (e.g., a public dataset link or description of your scraping process).
- If available, include citation or link to the dataset for reference.

### Preprocessing Steps
- **Cleaning:** Removal of unwanted characters and noise.
- **Tokenization:** Splitting tweets into tokens suitable for transformer input.
- **Formatting:** Converting the tweets into a format compatible with the model (e.g., numerical encoding).

## Model Architecture

The core of this project is a transformer model that has been pre-trained and then fine-tuned for tweet generation. The architecture includes:
- **Embedding Layer:** Converts input tokens into dense vectors.
- **Transformer Blocks:** Multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward networks to capture tweet context.
- **Output Layer:** A language modeling head that predicts the next token in the sequence.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies. Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asra020601/tweet_gen.git
cd tweet_generation
```

## Usage

### Preprocessing Data
Run the preprocessing script to prepare your tweet dataset for fine-tuning.

```bash
python preprocess.py --data_path data/tweets.csv --output_path data/processed.pkl
```

### Fine-tuning the Model
Fine-tune the transformer model on the processed tweet data.

```bash
python fine_tune.py --data data/processed.pkl --epochs 10 --batch_size 16
```

### Generating Tweets
After fine-tuning, generate tweets by providing a prompt.

```bash
python generate.py --model_path models/fine_tuned_model.pt --prompt "Enter your prompt here"
```

## Fine-tuning Details

The fine-tuning process includes:
- **Hyperparameter Configuration:** Custom settings for learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs.
- **Loss Function:** Cross-entropy loss is used for training the language model.
- **Optimizer:** Adam is used for optimizing the model.
